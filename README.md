# -Terraform-Commands-Validation-Lab
In this lab, I learned how to validate Terraform configurations, fix syntax and argument errors, understand the difference between terraform validate and terraform apply, format configuration files, inspect provider plugins, and use important Terraform commands like terraform graph and terraform providers mirror.
